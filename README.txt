2048-android
============

AGILE METHODOLOGY

- I was the scrum leader for this school project so I didnâ€™t do all of the coding but I had a hand in everything that was done. I also handled organizing my entire team + developing the scope and keeping track of what was being completed each sprint of the project. 

We pulled game off of GitHub open source. Refactored the original 2048 game to have added multiplayer, as well as a friends list feature + online stats and high scores. (ALL DATA STORAGE DONE THROUGH FIREBASE).
